      <h1>Farming CBA Decision Aid Technical Appendix</h1>
      <p>
        This appendix explains how the Farming Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) Decision Aid works.
        It describes each tab in the tool, defines all indicators in plain language, and sets out the formulas used for the calculations.
        The aim is to support both non technical users such as farmers and technical users such as economists, agronomists, and analysts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool is designed to be flexible.
        You can use it with the example faba bean dataset or replace the data with other crops and new trial results.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Structure of the tool</h2>
      <p>The tool has several tabs that work together.</p>
      <h3>1.1 Tabs and their roles</h3>
      <p><strong>Introduction tab.</strong> Gives a high level overview of the tool, the idea of cost benefit analysis, and how to read the main indicators.</p>
      <p><strong>Treatments tab.</strong> Describes the different farming options that can be compared.
        For example, a control practice and one or more improved treatments.
        Treatment inputs include yield, labour cost, other operating costs, and any capital requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>Costs tab.</strong> Allows you to specify detailed cost information for capital and other cost categories.
        Capital cost includes a depreciation row, which spreads the cost of assets over their useful life.
        For non capital categories, there is no depreciation row.</p>
      <p><strong>Simulation tab.</strong> Brings together the treatment data, costs, and farm level settings.
        You can choose the comparison (control versus treatment), set the farm size, planning horizon, discount rate, and adoption rate assumptions.
        Adoption rates are handled as part of sensitivity analysis in this tab.</p>
      <p><strong>Results tab.</strong> Summarises the outcomes of the simulation.
        It reports incremental net benefits, net present value (NPV), benefit cost ratio (BCR), payback period, and other selected indicators.</p>
      <p><strong>Technical appendix tab.</strong> Provides this full explanation of methods, formulas, and worked examples.</p>

      <h2>2. Guidance for non technical users</h2>
      <p>This section is written for farmers, extension workers, and other non technical users.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Key ideas in simple terms</h3>
      <p><strong>Control.</strong> This is the current practice on the farm.
        For example, using farmer saved seed and a basic fertiliser regimen.</p>
      <p><strong>Treatment.</strong> This is a new or improved practice.
        For example, using improved seed, better fertiliser, or additional agronomy support.</p>
      <p><strong>Yield.</strong> The amount of crop harvested per hectare, usually in kilograms or tonnes.
        Higher yield means more product to sell or consume.</p>
      <p><strong>Labour cost.</strong> The value of time spent on the crop.
        It can be the wage paid to workers or the value placed on the farmer’s own time.</p>
      <p><strong>Capital cost.</strong> Longer lasting items such as machinery, equipment, or irrigation systems.
        These are not used up in one year, so the tool spreads their cost over several years using depreciation.</p>
      <p><strong>Net benefit.</strong> The extra money you gain after paying all costs.
        In simple terms: extra income minus extra costs.</p>
      <p><strong>Net present value (NPV).</strong> The value today of the extra money you expect in future years.
        Future money is discounted because money available now is more valuable than the same amount in the future.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit cost ratio (BCR).</strong> Compares the value of benefits to the value of costs.
        If the BCR is greater than 1, benefits are larger than costs.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Step by step use for farmers</h3>
      <p><strong>Step 1. Choose the crop and treatments.</strong>
        On the Treatments tab, look at the control practice and the improved treatments.
        Check that the yield and cost numbers match your local situation or the trial results you trust.
        If needed, update the numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2. Check and update cost details.</strong>
        On the Costs tab, confirm the capital and other costs.
        For example, if a treatment needs a new sprayer or irrigation equipment, enter its cost and how many years it will last.
        The tool will calculate how much of that cost belongs to each year.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3. Set farm level settings.</strong>
        On the Simulation tab, select the comparison under “Control versus treatment”.
        Then enter the number of hectares, planning horizon (how many years you want to look ahead), and the discount rate.
        If you are not sure about the discount rate, you can use the default or test several values.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 4. Choose adoption rate assumptions.</strong>
        Still in the Simulation tab, use the adoption rate inputs to reflect how many farmers or how much area might adopt the treatment.
        You can run different simulations with low, medium, and high adoption to see how the results change.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 5. Run the simulation.</strong>
        When you change any input, the tool recalculates automatically.
        Move to the Results tab to see the impact of your choices.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 6. Interpret the results.</strong>
        Look first at whether the incremental net benefit per hectare is positive.
        If it is positive and the BCR is above 1, the treatment is financially attractive under your assumptions.
        Also consider how quickly costs are recovered and whether the required investment is feasible.</p>

      <h2>3. Guidance for technical users</h2>
      <p>This section is written for technical users who want to understand precisely how the calculations are performed.</p>

      <h3>3.1 Notation</h3>
      <p>The following notation is used in the formulas.</p>
      <p><strong>t</strong> is the year index, t = 0, 1, 2, …, T − 1.</p>
      <p><strong>T</strong> is the planning horizon in years.</p>
      <p><strong>r</strong> is the real discount rate per year.</p>
      <p><strong>A</strong> is the farm area in hectares that is relevant for the intervention.</p>
      <p><strong>a</strong> is the adoption rate as a proportion between 0 and 1.</p>
      <p><strong>Y<sub>c</sub></strong> is the yield under the control practice (per hectare per year).</p>
      <p><strong>Y<sub>t</sub></strong> is the yield under the treatment (per hectare per year).</p>
      <p><strong>P</strong> is the farmgate price of output per unit (for example per kilogram).</p>
      <p><strong>C<sub>c</sub></strong> is the total cost per hectare per year under the control practice, including labour.</p>
      <p><strong>C<sub>t</sub></strong> is the total cost per hectare per year under the treatment, including labour.</p>
      <p><strong>K</strong> is the capital cost associated with the treatment that is incurred at the start.</p>
      <p><strong>L</strong> is the useful life of the capital in years.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Annual benefits and costs per hectare</h3>
      <p><strong>Incremental yield per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>ΔY = Y<sub>t</sub> − Y<sub>c</sub></p>
      <p><strong>Incremental revenue per hectare per year.</strong></p>
      <p>B<sub>ha</sub> = ΔY × P</p>
      <p><strong>Incremental cost per hectare per year (excluding capital).</strong></p>
      <p>ΔC = C<sub>t</sub> − C<sub>c</sub></p>
      <p><strong>Annualised capital cost per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>For straight line depreciation, the annual capital charge is:</p>
      <p>K<sub>annual</sub> = K / L</p>
      <p>If K is expressed per hectare, this is already scaled by area.
        If K is per unit of equipment, it can be converted to a per hectare basis using expected area of use per year.</p>
      <p><strong>Net benefit per hectare per year.</strong></p>
      <p>NB<sub>ha</sub> = B<sub>ha</sub> − ΔC − K<sub>annual</sub></p>

      <h3>3.3 Scaling to farm level and adoption</h3>
      <p><strong>Effective area under treatment.</strong></p>
      <p>A<sub>eff</sub> = A × a</p>
      <p><strong>Annual net benefit at farm level.</strong></p>
      <p>NB<sub>farm,t</sub> = NB<sub>ha</sub> × A<sub>eff</sub></p>
      <p>In the simplest case, NB<sub>ha</sub> is constant over time.
        More complex profiles, for example learning or yield decline, can be implemented by specifying time specific values.</p>

      <h3>3.4 Net present value and benefit cost ratio</h3>
      <p><strong>Net present value (NPV).</strong></p>
      <p>NPV = −K<sub>0</sub> + Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T−1</sup> NB<sub>farm,t</sub> / (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></p>
      <p>K<sub>0</sub> is the initial capital cost paid at t = 0.
        If all capital has already been annualised into NB<sub>farm,t</sub>, K<sub>0</sub> can be set to zero to avoid double counting.</p>
      <p><strong>Present value of benefits.</strong></p>
      <p>PV(Benefits) = Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T−1</sup> B<sub>ha</sub> × A<sub>eff</sub> / (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></p>
      <p><strong>Present value of costs.</strong></p>
      <p>PV(Costs) = K<sub>0</sub> + Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T−1</sup> (ΔC + K<sub>annual</sub>) × A<sub>eff</sub> / (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></p>
      <p><strong>Benefit cost ratio (BCR).</strong></p>
      <p>BCR = PV(Benefits) / PV(Costs)</p>
      <p>If BCR is greater than 1, the treatment generates more discounted benefits than discounted costs.</p>

      <h3>3.5 Payback period</h3>
      <p>The payback period is the smallest number of years n for which the cumulative undiscounted net benefits cover the initial capital cost.</p>
      <p>Find the smallest n such that:</p>
      <p>Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>n</sup> NB<sub>farm,t</sub> ≥ K<sub>0</sub></p>
      <p>In some cases there may be no payback within the planning horizon.</p>

      <p><strong>Labour cost per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>For each treatment, labour cost per hectare is:</p>
      <p>Labour cost = Labour days per ha × Wage per day.</p>
      <p>For example for T1: Labour cost = 23 × 500 = ₹ 11,500 per hectare.</p>

      <p><strong>Total non capital cost per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>C<sub>t</sub> = Labour cost + Other operating cost.</p>
      <p>For T1: C<sub>t</sub> = 11,500 + 3,500 = ₹ 15,000 per hectare.</p>
      <p>For the control, labour cost is 20 × 500 = ₹ 10,000 per hectare.
        Total cost C<sub>c</sub> = 10,000 + 3,000 = ₹ 13,000 per hectare.</p>

      <p><strong>Annualised capital cost per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>For T1: K<sub>annual</sub> = 2,000 / 5 = ₹ 400 per hectare per year.</p>
      <p>For T2: K<sub>annual</sub> = 2,500 / 5 = ₹ 500 per hectare per year.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Worked example of the calculations</h2>
      <p>This section provides a full worked example for one comparison: Control (C0) versus Treatment 1 (T1).</p>

      <h3>5.1 Inputs from the dataset</h3>
      <p>From the example table:</p>
      <p>Control yield Y<sub>c</sub> = 1500 kg/ha.</p>
      <p>Treatment yield Y<sub>t</sub> = 1900 kg/ha.</p>
      <p>Price P = ₹ 40 per kg.</p>
      <p>Control total non capital cost C<sub>c</sub> = ₹ 13,000 per ha.</p>
      <p>Treatment total non capital cost C<sub>t</sub> = ₹ 15,000 per ha.</p>
      <p>Treatment capital cost K = ₹ 2,000 per ha.</p>
      <p>Capital life L = 5 years, so K<sub>annual</sub> = 400 per ha per year.</p>

      <h3>5.2 Per hectare annual values</h3>
      <p><strong>Incremental yield.</strong></p>
      <p>ΔY = 1900 − 1500 = 400 kg/ha.</p>
      <p><strong>Incremental revenue per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>B<sub>ha</sub> = ΔY × P = 400 × 40 = ₹ 16,000 per ha per year.</p>
      <p><strong>Incremental non capital cost per hectare.</strong></p>
      <p>ΔC = C<sub>t</sub> − C<sub>c</sub> = 15,000 − 13,000 = ₹ 2,000 per ha per year.</p>
      <p><strong>Net benefit per hectare per year.</strong></p>
      <p>NB<sub>ha</sub> = B<sub>ha</sub> − ΔC − K<sub>annual</sub>.</p>
      <p>NB<sub>ha</sub> = 16,000 − 2,000 − 400 = ₹ 13,600 per ha per year.</p>

      <h3>5.3 Scaling to farm level</h3>
      <p>Assume:</p>
      <p>Farm area A = 10 ha.</p>
      <p>Adoption rate a = 0.6 (60 percent of the area adopts the treatment).</p>
      <p>Effective area under treatment A<sub>eff</sub> = A × a = 10 × 0.6 = 6 ha.</p>
      <p>Annual net benefit at farm level:</p>
      <p>NB<sub>farm,t</sub> = NB<sub>ha</sub> × A<sub>eff</sub> = 13,600 × 6 = ₹ 81,600 per year.</p>

      <h3>5.4 Net present value and BCR</h3>
      <p>Assume a planning horizon T = 5 years and a discount rate r = 0.1 (10 percent).</p>
      <p>Initial capital cost at t = 0: K<sub>0</sub> = K × A<sub>eff</sub> = 2,000 × 6 = ₹ 12,000.</p>
      <p>Annual net benefit NB<sub>farm,t</sub> is assumed constant at ₹ 81,600 per year.</p>

      <p><strong>NPV.</strong></p>
      <p>NPV = −12,000 + Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>4</sup> 81,600 / (1.1)<sup>t</sup>.</p>
      <p>Year 0: 81,600 / 1 = 81,600.</p>
      <p>Year 1: 81,600 / 1.1 ≈ 74,182.</p>
      <p>Year 2: 81,600 / (1.1)<sup>2</sup> ≈ 67,438.</p>
      <p>Year 3: 81,600 / (1.1)<sup>3</sup> ≈ 61,307.</p>
      <p>Year 4: 81,600 / (1.1)<sup>4</sup> ≈ 55,733.</p>
      <p>Sum of discounted net benefits ≈ 81,600 + 74,182 + 67,438 + 61,307 + 55,733 ≈ 340,260.</p>
      <p>NPV ≈ −12,000 + 340,260 = ₹ 328,260.</p>

      <p><strong>PV of benefits.</strong></p>
      <p>PV(Benefits) uses B<sub>ha</sub> × A<sub>eff</sub> instead of NB<sub>ha</sub>.</p>
      <p>B<sub>farm</sub> = 16,000 × 6 = ₹ 96,000 per year.</p>
      <p>PV(Benefits) = Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>4</sup> 96,000 / (1.1)<sup>t</sup> ≈ 96,000 + 87,273 + 79,339 + 72,126 + 65,569 ≈ 400,307.</p>

      <p><strong>PV of costs.</strong></p>
      <p>Total extra cost per year per ha is ΔC + K<sub>annual</sub> = 2,000 + 400 = 2,400.</p>
      <p>Per year farm level extra cost is 2,400 × 6 = ₹ 14,400.</p>
      <p>PV(Costs) = 12,000 + Σ<sub>t=0</sub><sup>4</sup> 14,400 / (1.1)<sup>t</sup>.</p>
      <p>Discounted annual extra costs: 14,400 + 13,091 + 11,901 + 10,819 + 9,835 ≈ 60,046.</p>
      <p>PV(Costs) ≈ 12,000 + 60,046 = ₹ 72,046.</p>

      <p><strong>BCR.</strong></p>
      <p>BCR = PV(Benefits) / PV(Costs) ≈ 400,307 / 72,046 ≈ 5.6.</p>
      <p>A BCR of about 5.6 means that every rupee of extra cost returns about 5.6 rupees of extra benefit in present value terms.</p>

      <h3>5.5 Payback period</h3>
      <p>Cumulative undiscounted net benefits:</p>
      <p>Year 0: 81,600.</p>
      <p>Year 1: 81,600 + 81,600 = 163,200.</p>
      <p>Initial capital cost is 12,000.
        Even in year 0, cumulative net benefits already exceed 12,000, so the payback period is within the first year.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. How each tab uses the data and formulas</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Treatments tab</h3>
      <p>The Treatments tab stores the core agronomic and cost data for each option.
        For each treatment you can usually enter:</p>
      <p>Crop name and treatment name.</p>
      <p>Expected yield per hectare.</p>
      <p>Output price per unit.</p>
      <p>Labour days per hectare and wage per day, which together define labour cost per hectare.</p>
      <p>Other operating costs per hectare, such as fertiliser, pesticides, and fuel.</p>
      <p>Any capital cost per hectare, with its useful life in years.</p>
      <p>When you update a value, the tool automatically recalculates:</p>
      <p>Labour cost per hectare.</p>
      <p>Total non capital cost per hectare.</p>
      <p>Annualised capital cost per hectare.</p>
      <p>These feed into the incremental benefit and cost calculations in the Simulation and Results tabs.</p>

      <h3>6.2 Costs tab</h3>
      <p>The Costs tab allows more detailed input of cost items.
        Capital items include a depreciation row, and there are no depreciation rows for non capital categories.</p>
      <p>For each capital item you normally specify:</p>
      <p>Item description.</p>
      <p>Purchase cost per unit and number of units.</p>
      <p>Expected useful life in years.</p>
      <p>Area or number of hectares that the item serves.</p>
      <p>The tool then computes:</p>
      <p>Total capital cost K.</p>
      <p>Annualised capital cost K<sub>annual</sub> using straight line depreciation.</p>
      <p>Capital cost per hectare by dividing K<sub>annual</sub> by area served.</p>
      <p>Only capital cost lines include the depreciation logic.
        Other categories such as seed, fertiliser, pesticides, and fuel are treated as annual operating costs.</p>

      <h3>6.3 Simulation tab</h3>
      <p>The Simulation tab combines the data from the Treatments and Costs tabs with farm level settings.</p>
      <p>Key inputs are:</p>
      <p><strong>Control versus treatment.</strong> A dropdown where you select the treatment to compare against the control.
        Control is set as the base case, and the selected treatment is the improved option.</p>
      <p><strong>Farm area (hectares).</strong> The number of hectares on which the crop is grown.</p>
      <p><strong>Planning horizon (years).</strong> The number of years for which you want to simulate costs and benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>Discount rate.</strong> The real annual discount rate, entered as a percentage.
        If you are unsure, you can start with 10 percent and then explore other values.</p>
      <p><strong>Adoption rate assumptions.</strong> Inputs that control the adoption rate used in the simulation.
        The adoption rate is used as a sensitivity analysis variable.
        For example, the tool may allow you to specify a base adoption rate and a low and high case.
        Each scenario uses the same formulas but with different values of a.</p>
      <p>When settings are changed, the tool calculates:</p>
      <p>Per hectare incremental benefits and costs between treatment and control.</p>
      <p>Farm level annual net benefits based on area and adoption rate.</p>
      <p>Discounted values over the planning horizon, which feed into NPV and BCR.</p>

      <h3>6.4 Results tab</h3>
      <p>The Results tab summarises the outputs in a compact format.</p>
      <p>Typical indicators are:</p>
      <p><strong>Incremental net benefit per hectare per year.</strong> NB<sub>ha</sub> as defined above.</p>
      <p><strong>Total incremental net benefit per year at farm level.</strong> NB<sub>farm,t</sub> for each year or as an average.</p>
      <p><strong>Net present value (NPV).</strong> NPV over the planning horizon at the chosen discount rate.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit cost ratio (BCR).</strong> PV(Benefits) divided by PV(Costs).</p>
      <p><strong>Payback period.</strong> Number of years until cumulative undiscounted net benefits cover the initial investment.</p>
      <p>These results are directly linked to the formulas in Section 3 and the worked example in Section 5.</p>

      <h2>7. Adapting the tool for other crops and future trials</h2>
      <p>The tool is designed to be flexible so that it can be reused with other crops, locations, and trial results.</p>

      <h3>7.1 Replacing the dataset</h3>
      <p>To apply the tool to another crop:</p>
      <p>Update the crop and treatment names to describe the new practices.</p>
      <p>Replace the yield and price values with trial or farm data for the new crop.</p>
      <p>Update labour days, wage rates, and operating costs to reflect local conditions.</p>
      <p>Update any capital costs that are specific to the new practices, including useful life and area served.</p>
      <p>The underlying formulas are unchanged, so the Results tab will automatically show the new outcomes.</p>

      <h3>7.2 Extending the structure</h3>
      <p>Technical users can extend the structure in several ways without changing the core logic.</p>
      <p>You can add more treatments by adding rows in the Treatments tab.</p>
      <p>You can add extra cost categories provided they are treated consistently as annual operating costs or capital costs with depreciation.</p>
      <p>You can implement time varying yields or costs by specifying year specific values and adapting the formulas for NB<sub>ha,t</sub>.</p>

      <h3>7.3 Using the tool in participatory settings</h3>
      <p>In workshops with farmers or extension workers, the tool can be used in a participatory way.</p>
      <p>First, present the control and treatment options and check that the description matches the local reality.</p>
      <p>Second, ask participants to propose yields, costs, and adoption rates that they consider realistic.</p>
      <p>Third, enter these values into the tool and explore how results change.
        This helps participants understand which assumptions drive the results and where more evidence is needed.</p>

      <h2>8. Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The Farming CBA Decision Aid provides a structured way to compare control and treatment practices in farming using cost benefit analysis.
        It combines simple inputs on yields, prices, labour, operating costs, and capital with standard economic formulas for net benefits, net present value, and benefit cost ratios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non technical users can focus on entering realistic values and reading the key indicators.
        Technical users can rely on the explicit formulas in this appendix to verify and extend the tool.
        The same structure can be applied to many crops and intervention trials, provided that inputs are updated to match the specific context.
